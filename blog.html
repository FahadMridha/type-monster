                <h2>Qsn-1.what is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
                <h4>localStorage and sessionStorage:-</h4>
                <p>localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will
                    support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of
                    persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser
                    session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads.

                    Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is
                    preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you
                    should not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.

                    localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client
                    scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage
                    and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be
                    relied upon for storage of sensitive or security-related data within applications.

                <h2>Qsn-2.What is the difference between block scope and global scope?</h2>
                <h4>Block Scope:-</h4>
                <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                    variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                    statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the
                    curly brackets {}.
                </p>
                <h4>Global Scope:-</h4>
                <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                    have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                    program, any function or conditional state can access that variable..

                <h2>Qsn-3.How to work javascript event loop?</h2>
                <h4>Event Loop:-</h4>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. <br> We’ll
                    start with a somewhat of an odd claim — despite allowing async JavaScript code (like the setTimeout
                    we just discussed), until ES6, JavaScript itself has actually never had any direct notion of
                    asynchronicity built into it. The JavaScript engine has never done anything more than executing a
                    single chunk of your program at any given moment.

                    For more details on how JavaScript engines work (Google’s V8 specifically), check one of our
                    previous articles on the topic.

                    So, who tells the JS Engine to execute chunks of your program? In reality, the JS Engine doesn’t run
                    in isolation — it runs inside a hosting environment, which for most developers is the typical web
                    browser or Node.js. Actually, nowadays, JavaScript gets embedded into all kinds of devices, from
                    robots to light bulbs. Every single device represents a different type of hosting environment for
                    the JS Engine.

                <h2>Qsn-4.How to get undefined value in javascript?</h2>
                <h4>Get undefined :-</h4>
                <p>In a JavaScript program, the correct way to check if an object property is undefined is to use the
                    typeof operator. If the value is not defined, typeof returns the 'undefined' string.
                    A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also
                    returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
                    function returns undefined if a value was not returned.While you can use undefined as an identifier
                    (variable name) in any scope other than the global scope (because undefined is not a reserved word),
                    doing so is a very bad idea that will make your code difficult to maintain and debug.
